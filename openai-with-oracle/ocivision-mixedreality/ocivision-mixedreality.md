# Use Oracle Database, OCI Vision AI, Open AI, and Mixed Reality

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to use Oracle Database, OCI Vision AI, Open AI, and Mixed Reality. 
The use case involves the names of objects in a person's surroundings are spoken out to them from the spatial location where they are located for individuals that are hearing impaired or have Alzheimerâ€™s

Estimated Time:  10 minutes

### Objectives

-   Use Oracle Database, OCI Vision AI, Open AI, and Mixed Reality

### Prerequisites

- Completion of Setup lab

## Task 1: Execute an Open AI query and save the results in the database

1.    Build the src code project that was downloaded in the

```
    <copy>docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/free</copy>
   ```
Mixed Reality and Vision AI: - MR headset sends pictures of the surroundings to Vision AI service which detections the objects and sends them and their location back to the headset which plots them spatial and plays them back via text-to-speech


You may now **proceed to the next lab.**..
